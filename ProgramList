7. A. Write a program to simulate grep command using system calls
B. Write a program to generate and print Fibonacci series with the following requirements:
- Parent program should create a child and distribute the task of generating Fibonacci no to
its child.
- The code for generating Fibonacci no. should reside in different program.
- Child should write the generated Fibonacci sequence to a shared memory.
